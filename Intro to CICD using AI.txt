Welcome to Introduction
to CI/CD using AI. After watching this video, you'll be able to: define the significance
of AI and CI/CD, discuss the role
of AI and CI/CD, identify the challenges
of moving from the traditional CI
to an AI-driven CI, list a few AI-enabled
CI/CD tools and platforms, explain a few scenarios where AI is used in
software development, explore the future trends and considerations of
using AI in CI/CD. 

Let's begin by recalling
what CI/CD is. CI/CD is an acronym for continuous integration and continuous development
or deployment. It is a method to
frequently deliver applications by
leveraging automation. Now, imagine a software
development team incorporating AI-driven testing tools
into their CI/CD workflow. As they make code changes, these AI tools autonomously recognize the most
crucial test cases drastically reducing
testing time and manual effort by maintaining
high software quality. This integration
not only expedites the development process but also enhances overall
productivity and efficiency in delivering
reliable software. Let's discuss the
important areas where AI is reshaping CI/CD processes. The first area is
automated testing and quality assurance. AI-driven testing tools
automate the testing process, ensuring software quality
by identifying issues. Next, code analysis
and optimization. AI tools, employing machine
learning algorithms, detect patterns and code
issues and recommend optimizations for better code-based performance
and maintenance. They enhance code
quality, security, and adhere to coding standards, leading to higher-quality code and faster delivery cycles. Next, AI helps in
software deployment. 

Predictive analytics,
powered by AI, revolutionizes software
development and CI/CD pipelines. By analyzing historical data
and environmental factors, AI models predict
deployment risks, enabling proactive
issue resolution and optimizing deployment
strategies for efficiency. 

Further, AI facilitates intelligent release
orchestration. AI-driven release
orchestration tools intelligently schedule software
component deployments, understanding dependencies
and resource constraints. They adapt to changes such as
scaling resources based on demand or rolling back deployment if anomalies
are detected, ensuring smooth deployments across different environments. Continuous monitoring
and feedback. 



AI-based monitoring
tools instantly detect abnormal behavior and security threats, enabling proactive
issue resolution and ensuring system reliability. Additionally, AI
analyzes user feedback for insights that aid future feature deployment
and enhancements. Embracing a potential of AI and CI/CD confronts challenges, and yet, there is an array of AI-enabled CI/CD tools and platforms that help in
software development. A few of them include, Jenkins: an open-source
automation server known for its CI/CD
capabilities. IBM Watson Studio, WS, and Watson Machine Learning, WML: offers DevOps
automation for ML workflows. Codefresh: utilizes AI for intelligent caching
and predictive scaling, enhancing the
development process. GitLab CI/CD: seamlessly integrates with version control for streamlined
CI/CD management. PagerDuty AIOps:
leverages intelligence and automation to aid engineering teams and
incident response. Harness: uses AI
to revolutionize software release processes through automation and analysis. Snyk: incorporates AI and ML for automated
security testing and vulnerability management. Dynatrace's Davis AI: an automated engine assisting in managing complex
IT environments. Let's look at a
few examples where AI-driven tools help in
software development. Let's take a scenario where a
development team integrates an AI-driven tool into
their CI/CD pipeline. What difference
can AI bring here? The AI analyzes
new code changes, automatically creating
comprehensive test cases, reducing manual effort, and
enhancing testing quality. In another scenario,
employing AI, an organization predicts
potential build failures in their CI/CD pipeline. Here, AI helps to analyze historical data and
identify failure patterns, alerting teams beforehand for preemptive actions and
smoother software delivery. Now let's explore the
evolving trends for improved decision making
within software development. In the future, you will see
AI-driven operationalization. Monitoring and observability
solutions now integrate advanced AI
capabilities to enhance understanding of application
performance and behavior. These solutions furnish
valuable information that can influence
continuous delivery as CI/CD solutions integrate with diverse data sources to anticipate application
or service defects, report such
information, and take necessary actions as a
part of the CI/CD process. Next, AI will elevate
delivery of health insights. AI and ML techniques correlate metrics with
business objectives, providing deeper insights into application
release quality, including explainable
AI features clarifies decision rationale, enhancing AI/ML
model utilization within the CI/CD pipelines. Automated verification. AI and machine learning
techniques like natural language processing
and pattern recognition empower users to
swiftly and accurately analyze data from
various CI/CD tools. Integrating AI/ML accelerates software verification and
introduces scalability, facilitating automated
decision-making in the delivery pipeline. In this video, you learned that CI/CD is used to deliver
applications using automation. Some of the common
AI-enabled CI/CD tools and platforms that help in software development
include Jenkins, IBM Watson Studio, WS, and Watson Machine Learning, WML, Codefresh, GitLab, CI/CD, PagerDuty AIOps, Harness, Snyk,
Dynatrace's Davis AI. In the future, AI will help to achieve AI-driven
operationalization, elevate delivery
health insights, and automate verification.
